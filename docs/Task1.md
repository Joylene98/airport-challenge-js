# Airport Challenge â€“ Task 1

**Introduction**

Imagine a world where there is no way to control the flow of airplanes. How would an air traffic controller know when an airport is full? How would an airport manage their capacity when there are huge storms? How would an airport be able to ensure that safety is maintained if such weather condition occur? Now there is an answer to these questions. The answer is to create a flow control software to manage the flow of planes in an airport. 
The software will allow you to know when the airport has reached its maximum capacity. Your software will notify air traffic controllers to let them know when it is safe or not safe to land a plane. The software ensures that safety is a number one priority as planes cannot land or take off when the airport is full. The software does this by keeping track of the number of planes in the airport.

**What are the benefits of the software and how will it benefit you?** 

The software will:
-	Help control the flow of planes to reduce risk of the capacity of the airport overflowing. 
-	Define the capacity of the airport.
-	Ensure to keep track of the capacity of the airport.
-	Ensure the capacity is used where appropriate. 
-	Help keep track of planes that has either landed or due to take off from the airport.
-	Allow Air Traffic Controllers to know when to instruct a plane to take off. 
-	Allow Air Traffic Controllers to know when to instruct a plane to land.

**How will the software benefit you?**

- The software has a setting feature that helps to set the capacity of the airport. It also monitors the capacity to ensure that the number of planes does not exceed the airport capacity. This means you would not have to worry about having many planes at the airport. This feature ensures that the airport capacity is managed appropriately.
  
-  The software has a land plane feature. The feature allows air traffic controllers to instruct a plane to land when the airport is not full. Also, the feature checks the location of a plane, and will only allow an air traffic controller to instruct a plane to land when the plane is not at the airport. This feature provides benefits to you as it avoids duplicate of planes in the airport and it helps to reduce the number of planes at the airport.

- The take off feature also checks the location of the plane before an air traffic controller can instruct a plane to take off. This feature provides benefit to you such as removing the plane from the airport once a plane is instructed to take off. This helps to provide space in the airport and ensures that the number of planes in the airport are updated. Also, by providing space in the airport, it allows other planes to land.

**What problems does the software solve?**

Your software solves the following problems:
-	**Capacity overflow**: the software has a useful feature which keeps track of the number of planes that the airport can hold. Once, the airport has reached its maximum capacity, the air traffic controller can instruct the plane not to land. 
-	**Not updating the number of planes in the airport**: if the number of planes in the airport are not tracked, how would you know if the airport has reached the capacity? The software has a feature which counts and updates the number of planes that are in the airport. This is a useful feature as it helps Air Traffic controller to decide whether they can instruct a plane to land, not land, take off or not to take off.
-	**Not ensuring that the capacity is used appropriately**: the software also has another feature which checks that only the planes that are in the airport are counted once. This ensures that your software avoids providing misinformation to the Air Traffic controller about the number of planes currently in the airport.

**What are the risks associated with the software?**

The risks associated with software are:
- **Having too many planes at the airport**: when the number of planes are not updated each time a plane lands at the airport. This could lead to the airport having too many planes. This could also prevent other planes from not being able to land. It is important that the number of planes are updated regularly to avoid inconsistencies on the amount of planes at the airport.
- **Having duplicates planes recorded**: when a plane located in the airport is counted twice, this would mean that the information about the number of planes is updated wrongly. Also, it would mean that the capacity is not used appropriately. Also, it would cause other planes that are not in airport to be instructed not to land.
- **An air traffic controller providing wrong instructions to a plane**: for instance, if a plane is instructed to take off when it is not currently at the airport. This would cause problems such as the air traffic controller would think that the plane is at the airport. Also, by instructing the plane to take off, it would mean the number of planes at the airport would decrease. Also, this would mean that the airport would hold incorrect information on the number of planes. 

**Conclusion** 

Overall, the software provides a meaningful solution such as ensuring the capacity of the airport is managed to avoid overflow in capacity. Also, the software keeps the records of the number of planes at the airport. Although there are risks associated with the software such as having too many planes at the airport, having duplicates records of planes and wrong instructions provided by air traffic controllers. I believe that when the features of the software are implemented correctly it will help limit the risks of software. Your software is still the answer to manage the flow of planes as it ensures safety is maintained when doing so.
